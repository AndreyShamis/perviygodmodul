 * EX4A:: Income classification
 
 *  Plan that defines an array of integers twenty cells.
 *  The plan calls for the user natural number n less than
 *  or equal to twenty, which indicates how many numbers the
 *  user wants to enter the array. Then the program reads n numbers.
 
		Compile:	g++ -Wall ex4a.cc -o ex4a
Instruction to use:
	Entered data:	Like: 
10

	Returnening data:	sorted


	
 * EX4B:: U.S. President selection system
 
Each country is allocated a fixed number in the United States of Alktorim. 
"Winner in that country 'won' every 'Halktorim" of that country. 
Winning the general election is accumulated more Alktorim (even if in 
practice he gained fewer votes of his colleagues among the voters, as 
indeed happened Kennedy against Nixon). to assume that interest 
if any in his bag, then none of the candidates does not get 
Balktorim of that country.

 * EX4C:: Counting negative / E - Negative array sorted

 The program sorts the numbers entered her small grow using Bubble sort 
 algorithm. After sorting the program to some negative values, and some 
 non negative values (positive or zero) are a pair of array and display data. 
 So let the program includes two numbers with a space between them (the first 
 indicates how the array contains negative values, a few other non negative values).

		Compile:	g++ -Wall ex4c.cc -o ex4c
Instruction to use:
	Entered data: like:
6
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6
	Returnening data: numbers of negative and positive numbers
